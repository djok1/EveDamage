# EveDamage
School Project that helps read eve combat logs. 
I have uploaded a demonstration video of how the program works to both the repository and youtube here https://youtu.be/JVJzqUc4ZIk 
I learned a lot from this project I built it in C# using visual studio IDE and I understand there are a lot of mistakes in this project that ended up forcing me down a specific path and I learned what lava code really is once I am out of school I plan to rebuild this as web app using asp.net core.
